# African-EHR-system
Health care is changing and so are the tools used to coordinate better care for patients like you and me. During your most recent visit to the doctor, you may have noticed your physician entering notes on a computer or laptop into an electronic health record (EHR). With EHRs comes the opportunity for patients to receive improved coordinated care from providers and easier access to their health information. It’s a way to make it easier for everyone to be better informed and more involved in the patient’s health care. However When a patient arrives more or less unconscious in a hospital, doctors are often confronted with many questions due to lack of medical records. Who to call? Is the person allergic to any treatment? Has he ever undergone any operation? It is on the basis of this observation, reported repeatedly by emergency doctors, that we would like to use simple technologies through this project to increase medical radius, accelerate detection and families’ warning, and support management of activities. The IT system we would like to develop enables remote follow-up of children, keeping of medical records, and production of reports and health statistics. Our aim: ehealth card with QR CODE and app for all. You are all invited to join the adventure
